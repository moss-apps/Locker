# Flick Integration Guide

## Goal

Flick should behave like a first-class playback companion for Locker:

- Locker hands Flick a hidden song with a normal Android audio `VIEW` intent.
- Flick plays that URI directly without copying it into public storage.
- Flick exposes an explicit `Back to Locker` action.
- Returning from Flick should foreground the existing Locker task when it is already running.

This keeps the two apps feeling like one ecosystem instead of two unrelated apps.

## Locker Contract

Locker now exposes these Android integration points:

- Locker package: `com.ultraelectronica.locker`
- Return URI: `locker://return`
- Main activity launch mode: `singleTask`
- Return intent filter: `ACTION_VIEW` on `locker://return`

What that means for Flick:

- If Locker is already open in the background, opening `locker://return` will bring that existing task forward.
- If Locker is not running, Android will cold-start it.
- Locker does not need a custom action for v1. Standard Android `VIEW` for audio is enough.

## What Flick Should Implement

### 1. Accept standard Android audio `VIEW` intents

Flick should expose an exported playback activity that can handle audio sent from Locker.

Recommended manifest shape:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".player.ExternalPlaybackActivity"
    android:exported="true">

    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <data android:scheme="content" />
        <data android:mimeType="audio/*" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

Notes:

- Supporting `content://` is the important part.
- Keep MIME support broad: `audio/*`.
- You can add narrower types later if you want analytics or specialized handling.
- Do not require custom permissions from Locker.

## 2. Read the incoming URI directly

Locker will hand Flick a temporary readable audio URI. Flick should stream from it instead of copying it into gallery-visible storage.

If Flick uses Media3 / ExoPlayer, the flow should look like this:

```kotlin
val audioUri = intent?.data ?: return

val mediaItem = MediaItem.fromUri(audioUri)
player.setMediaItem(mediaItem)
player.prepare()
player.playWhenReady = true
```

If Flick does any preflight validation, do it through `ContentResolver`:

```kotlin
contentResolver.openAssetFileDescriptor(audioUri, "r")?.use {
    // URI is readable
}
```

Important behavior:

- Do not move the file into shared storage.
- Do not rescan it into the media library.
- Do not assume the URI is permanent.
- Release the URI and player resources when playback is done.

## 3. Preserve Locker's privacy model

Flick should treat Locker-supplied media as temporary private content.

Recommended rules on the Flick side:

- No background indexing of Locker media.
- No automatic caching to public folders.
- No automatic cloud sync for the handed-off file.
- No thumbnail export into gallery-visible locations.
- If caching is needed for playback stability, keep it inside Flick's private app storage and clean it up aggressively.

## 4. Add a dedicated `Back to Locker` action

Do not rely only on Android back-stack behavior. It may feel okay in some cases, but explicit return is more reliable and intentional.

Flick should expose a visible action in the player UI such as:

- `Back to Locker`
- `Return to Locker`
- `Done in Flick`

Recommended implementation:

```kotlin
private fun returnToLocker(context: Context) {
    val intent = Intent(
        Intent.ACTION_VIEW,
        Uri.parse("locker://return?source=flick")
    ).apply {
        `package` = "com.ultraelectronica.locker"
        addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_BROWSABLE)
        addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP or Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP)
    }

    context.startActivity(intent)
}
```

Why this is the right shape:

- `package = "com.ultraelectronica.locker"` makes the return deterministic.
- `locker://return` matches Locker's manifest contract.
- `CLEAR_TOP` and `SINGLE_TOP` help Android reuse the running Locker activity instead of creating unnecessary duplicates.

If you want to be defensive, wrap the launch in a `try/catch` and fall back to a normal `finish()` if Locker is unavailable.

## 5. Keep Flick's package name stable

For the first version, Locker can still hand off audio through the normal Android app chooser or generic open flow.

For tighter ecosystem integration later, Locker will need Flick's stable Android package name so it can:

- detect whether Flick is installed
- show a dedicated `Play with Flick` action
- target Flick directly instead of showing every compatible audio app

So on the Flick side, avoid changing the package identifier casually once you settle on one.

## Recommended UX Flow

1. User taps a song in Locker.
2. Locker can either play it internally or hand it to Flick.
3. Flick opens directly on a playback screen.
4. Flick makes it obvious the track came from Locker.
5. User taps `Back to Locker`.
6. Flick launches `locker://return`.
7. Locker comes back to the foreground in its existing state.

Good small UX touches in Flick:

- Show a small `Opened from Locker` label.
- Keep the return action visible without burying it in a menu.
- If playback fails, offer `Back to Locker` in the error state too.

## Test Checklist

Run these checks before calling the integration done:

1. Launch an MP3 from Locker into Flick.
2. Verify Flick can read the URI without copying it to public storage.
3. Verify playback works for at least `mp3`, `m4a`, and `ogg`.
4. Tap `Back to Locker` and confirm the existing Locker task returns.
5. Confirm Locker is not duplicated in recents.
6. Confirm the handed-off song does not appear in gallery/music scanners because of Flick.
7. Confirm closing Flick does not leave stale temp playback state behind.

## Future Tightening

Once Flick's package name is final, Locker can add a dedicated package-targeted handoff path. That would allow:

- a direct `Play with Flick` button in Locker
- an install check for Flick
- skipping the generic app chooser when Flick is present

The v1 contract in this document is enough to start building the ecosystem now.
